# BANK_OPERATING_SYSTEM

## Overview of the project

This is a simple Python-based banking system simulation designed to demonstrate basic banking functionalities including account creation, deposits, withdrawals, interest calculation, address updates, and transaction history tracking. It models core banking operations using object-oriented programming concepts.

## Features
- 1.Create bank accounts with unique account numbers
- 2.Deposit and withdraw money with validation checks
- 3.Track transaction history for deposits, withdrawals, and interest credited
- 4.Calculate and add interest on the account balance over a period of years
- 5.Update account holder's address details
- 6.Display current account balance and transaction mini-statement
- 7.CLI-based user interface for interactive operations

## Technologies/tools used
- 1)Python 
- i)Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- ii)def function
- iii)conditional statement


## Standard input/output for command line interaction
- 1)Steps to install & run the project
- i)Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- ii)Clone the repository:

```git clone <repository-url>```
Navigate to the project directory:


```cd <repository-folder>```
Run the main Python file:

```python bank.py```
Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the banking system.

## Instructions for testing
- 1)After running the program, use the menu options to test functionalities:
- 2)Deposit positive amounts (option 1)
- 3)Withdraw amounts within balance (option 2)
- 4)View mini-statement to verify transaction history (option 3)
- 5)Add interest and check updated balance (option 4)
- 6)Change the account address and confirm update (option 5)
- 7)Show account details for verification (option 6)
- 8)Exit program using option 7

Try edge cases like negative deposits/withdrawals to test validation messages.

Verify that account numbers auto-increment with each new account created in an extended version.
